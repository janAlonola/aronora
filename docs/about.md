# About Me

I like to call myself Simon Bebek formally, or Argon, Aronora, jan Alonola and so on.

I'm from Germany with ancestry from Silesia. I speak [Silesian](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Silesian_language), but only through my parents, so my vocabulary is limited.

In my freetime I do a lot of things, as playing violin for example. Or making YouTube videos on [my channel](https://www.youtube.com/@Aronora).

I co-founded [lipu tenpo](https://liputenpo.org/) e.V. and am current member of the board.

Despite my natlangs German, Silesian, English, I also speak Toki Pona fairly fluently and am interested in [Globasa](https://www.globasa.net/eng) and [Kokanu](https://en.kokanu.com/).
